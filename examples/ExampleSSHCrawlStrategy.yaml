provider: ["ssh"]     # ("ssh")       - Currently only ssh provider is supported. Future plans for "aws" and "k8s"
protocol: "EXP"       # (str)         - A user defined PROTOCOL.  Defined in ()[./web.yaml] Used for display, you can then skip crawling by passing --skip-protocols
providerArgs:         # (dict)        - A dict of arguments for each provider. 'ssh': ['ssh_command']
    foo: |
        any number of provider args can be passed in
        and will be passed along to the provider(s) used by this crawl strategy
childProvider:          # (dict) - Determines what provider children found will employ to further crawl
    type: "matchAll"        # ("matchAll", "matchhPort", "matchAddress") - "matchAll" will employ 1 child provider for all children.
    provider: "ssh"         # Use "matchOnly" to specify a provider for children children found on specific
#    type: "matchPort"      # ports
